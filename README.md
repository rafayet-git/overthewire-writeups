I made this mainly to track my own progress, but I've also included my own thinking process and further context for each problem. Hopefully it'll also help you learn how to solve similar problems, including ones outside of Overthewire.

**NOTE**: Passwords and steps may change frequently, so don't blindly follow writeups.

If you need further help, there are plenty of people like myself that are willing to assist you. Try going to the [OverTheWire chat](https://overthewire.org/information/chat.html) on Discord or IRC. Crazy that IRC is still a thing huh
